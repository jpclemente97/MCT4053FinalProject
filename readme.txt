To run each of the python files, simply run the command "python <filename>" in the terminal. The command line will show the R2 score at the end of running for the regressors, and the accuracy score with a confusion matrix at the end of running for the classifiers. In the same folder, a MIDI file will be generated with the same name as the python file, except with ".mid" at the end. I have previously generated MIDI files in the "previouslyGeneratedMidiFiles" folder, as well as those files synchronized to the test video in the folder "testVideoWithSynchronizedMidiFiles", to show a sample of the results these files generate.
